- Rhetoric as the [basis of persuasion]{.note}

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}

> "*We are to observe that … subordinate propositions should not be above five in number. When they exceed this number the mind cannot easily comprehend them at one view; and the whole runs into confusion. Three or thereabout is a very proper number; and it is observed that this number is much more easily comprehended than two or four. In the number three there is, as it were, a middle and two extremes; but in two or four there is no middle on which attention can be fixed*." (pp. 142–43)
