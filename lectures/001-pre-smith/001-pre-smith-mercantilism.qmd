[Nine]{.note} rules:

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}

1. That every inch of a country’s soil be utilized for agriculture, mining, or manufacturing;
2. That all raw materials found in a country be used in domestic manufacture, since finished goods have a higher value than raw materials;
3. That a large, working population be encouraged;
4. That all export of gold and silver be prohibited and all domestic money be kept in circulation;
5. That all imports of foreign goods be discouraged as much as possible;
6. That where certain imports are indispensable they be obtained at firsthand, in exchange for other domestic goods instead of gold and silver;
7. That as much as possible, imports be confined to raw materials that can be finished at home;
8. That opportunities be constantly sought for selling a country’s surplus manufactures to foreigners, so far as necessary, for gold and silver;
9. That no importation be allowed if such goods are sufficiently and suitably supplied at home.

"*Although a Kingdom may be enriched by gifts received, or by purchase taken from some other Nations, yet these are things uncertain and of small consideration. The ordinary means therefore to encrease our wealth and treasure is by Forraign Trade, wherein wee must ever observe this rule: to sell more to strangers yearly than wee consume of theirs in value*" (ch. 2)
